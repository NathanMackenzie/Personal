            <h1>3.1MW Turbine Blade<br/>& Control Design</h1>
            <p>This document will outline both the process and results of designing a 3.1 megawatt turbine and the control system to accompany it. Initially, several design criteria will presented and some assumptions made in order to create this design. It should be noted that this is merely an areodynamic design with little emphasis on the structural, fatigue, and noise aspects need in order to make a safe and marketable turbine. Furthermore, control design will rely on use of a hypothetical (yet reasonable) transfer function, since the calculation of a such requires information beyound the scope of this project (such as the generators transfer function). </p>
