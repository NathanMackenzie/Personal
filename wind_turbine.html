            <h1>3.1 MW Turbine Blade<br/>& Control Design</h1>
            <p>
                This page will highlight the process and        results of designing a 3.1-megawatt wind turbine and the control system to accompany it. Initially, several design criteria are presented and with those some initial design choices made that will become the basis of the rest of the project. It should be noted that this is merely an aerodynamic design with little emphasis on the structural, fatigue, and noise aspects needed to make a safe and marketable turbine. Furthermore, control design will rely on the use of a hypothetical (yet reasonable) transfer function, since the calculation of a such is beyond the scope of this project. </p>
            <h4>Part One: Blade Design</h4>
            <h5>Initial Criteria</h5>
            <p>
                Below are the three initial design constraints (Table 1). The turbine is to have a rated capacity of 3.1 MW when operating at a wind speed of 11 m/s. Also, the generator and gearbox efficiency will be 86%. This is important since the energy which the blade must extract from the wind will be closer to 3.6 MW, in order to accommodate for these losses within the nacelle.
            </p>
            <p class="titles">Table 1. Initial design criteria.</p>

            <h5>Initial Decisions</h5>
            <p>
                Next, three design decisions are made (Table 2). This turbine will be a three-blade design with a hub radius of 3 meters. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tip-speed_ratio">tip speed ratio</a> (TSR) of 8 will be used. This is an arbitrary decision but reasonable seeing as most large scale turbines have a TSR between 6-8.

            <h5>Airfoil</h5>
            <p>
                The <a href="http://airfoiltools.com/airfoil/details?airfoil=ah93w145-il">Althaus AH 93-W-145</a> airfoil will be used for this turbine. With a relatively flat bottom it's a good low speed design commonly in use on wind turbines. Using <a href="https://web.mit.edu/drela/Public/web/xfoil/">XFOIL</a> the lift and drag coefficients of this airfoil are found for varying angles of attack (Figure 1). 
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                With a list of these thrust and drag coefficients, a graph can be made plotting the ratio of lift to drag versus the angle of attack (Graph 1). This allows for an optimal angle of attack of roughly 5.2 degrees to be determined.

            <p>
                Before the twist of the blade can be calculated, the blades radius must first be determined. Though the radius cannot be known for certain until after a BEM analysis has been performed, an accurate prediction can be made for this first design iteration. Using equation 1, set the downstream wind velocity to 11m/s, power to 3.1 MW, and coefficient of performance to .45. The true COP also won't be known until after the BEM analysis, but a value of .45 is close to modern large scale wind turbines. It should be noted that this value must not exceed .593, for it would then be in violation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betz%27s_law">Betz limit</a>.</p>

            <p class="titles">Equation 1. Power equation.</p>
            <p>
                Since the proper turbine radius has already been determined through an iterative design approch, we'll continue forward with a radius of 56 meter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next the twist and chord length of the blade are calculated. Since the angle of the relative velocity of incoming flow changes the further out on the blade you travel, so must the angle of the blade to ensure the optimal AOA is maintained (Table 3). Also, as the velocity of the incoming flow increases the further out on the blade you travel, the optimal chord length must decrease (Graph 2). 
            </p>

            <p>
                In turbine design a majority of the power comes from the outer 2/3rd's of the blade. This is because the moment arm acting about the hub of the rotor is longer. Also, the blade will need to taper in towards the hub at some point. Therefore, the chord of this blade will begin decreasing in length once it reaches 5m, at roughly 16m from the hub.

                Blade Element Momentum Analysis (BEM)
            </h5>
            <p>
                Now that the blade is designed, the theoretical performance can be anlyzed using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_element_momentum_theory">Blade Element Momentum Theory</a>. BEM analysis predicts the COP at different TSR's for the designed turbine, as well as the thrust coefficients (Figure 2). Using the theoretical COP and plugging back into equation 1, the design can be checked to see whether the blade will produce enough power. If not, an iterative approach must be taken where a parameter-such as turbine radius-is adjusted and calculation redone to see if the new blade meets performance specifications.
